# Was machen?

Simple, searchable list of what to do around Nuremberg, Germany.

## Rationale

Because I think it's far too cumbersome to get an overview of what I can do
in my free time. I just want to check _one_ list instead of multiple web
sites. Especially because some of them don't perform very well (I'm looking
at you, [cinecitta.de](https://www.cinecitta.de)).

Others are quite helpful in their departement but lack content I am
interested in. [Mehrwert Zone](https://mwz.mobi/), for example, gives a
similar listing and even offers a location based search, but is lacking
movie screenings.

Finally, I want this list to be as accessible as possible because I like
to check my options when I'm out and about. So it should also load as fast
as possible, even on a bad connection.

## Requirements

The following packages need to be installed to generate the static HTML pages:

	$ pip3 install untangle requests

## Generation

There's a Python script that's supposed to run on midnight that will generate
a couple of static HTML pages in the given directory:

	$ ./bin/update_events.py htdocs res/screen.css

The second argument is the style sheet to embed in the static HTML pages.
The style sheet is embedded because it is quite small and embedding keeps
browsers from showing unstyled content when on a bad connection.

In this repo, you can simply run `make` to regenerate the HTML files:

	$ make

Now, you just need to put `htdocs` on a web server.
